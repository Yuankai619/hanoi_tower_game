## **üéÆ Game Overview**
Hanoi Tower is a classic puzzle game where the goal is to move all disks from the first rod (A) to the third rod (C), following these rules:

1. **Only one disk can be moved at a time.**
2. **A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.**
3. **All disks must be moved to the third rod (C) to complete the level.**

Each level increases the number of disks, making the challenge progressively harder!
